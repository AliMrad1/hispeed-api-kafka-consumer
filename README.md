This GitHub repository houses a Spring Boot application that demonstrates the implementation of a Kafka consumer. The application is designed to consume messages from one or more Kafka topics and process them using Spring Kafka.

## Features

- **Kafka Integration:** The repository showcases how to set up a Spring Boot project to integrate with Apache Kafka, a popular distributed messaging system.

- **Consumer Configuration:** It includes configuration files and code for defining Kafka consumer properties, such as the Kafka broker address, deserializers, and consumer group settings.

- **Message Processing:** The Spring Boot application provides examples of message processing logic, demonstrating how to handle Kafka messages effectively.

- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling and exception management techniques are employed to ensure smooth message consumption even in the presence of errors.

- **Logging:** Detailed logging is included to facilitate troubleshooting and monitoring of message consumption activities.

- **Dependency Management:** The project uses popular dependency management tools, making it easy to update and maintain the application.

- **Documentation:** The repository may include documentation or a README file to provide setup instructions and usage guidelines for the Kafka consumer application.

- **Unit Tests:** Where applicable, unit tests are provided to ensure the reliability and correctness of the Kafka consumer components.
